        <description>In order to reach a state of consistent manufactured quality and scaling quantity, a standard of production and maintenance must be established. Androids come in a vast number of styles and designs - standardizing the colony's parts will be critical for success in mechanical fields.</description>

		<description>The standardization of designs, components, and assembly techniques allows for the standardization of parts, and thus, interchangeability. Dedicating resources to designing easily replaceable, upgradeable parts will open up new avenues for specialization and efficiency gains.</description>

        <tab>ATR_MechResearch</tab>
        <description>Standardizing communication and digital presence technologies will allow a baseline for a network of connected mechanical units and devices. The advent of a theoretical cloud environment connecting those consciousnesses and devices could allow for great opportunities for insights into shared experience, security, or remote attacks on hostile entitites. It all begins with infrastructure.</description>

        <discoveredLetterTitle>About: SkyMind Network</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>You have unlocked the basic components for a SkyMind network. While organic pawns can't make use of it yet, building a SkyMind relay tower will allow powered devices to be remotely turned on (and have some special functions in some cases) and mechanical pawns with an installed core (no drones) to connect.\n\nPawns connected to the network can be transferred to other connected pawns (or androids that have an autonomous core freshly installed), and may be uploaded to, downloaded from, or duplicated within a SkyMind Core once one is built.\n\nNetworked servers will allow you to accrue insights into skill, security, or hacking fields. You will need databases to store points, and either analysts or researchers on a SkyMind-connected research bench to generate points. Skill points can give pawns xp or passions. Security points protect against enemy hacks on your network. Hacking points can be used against others' networks for benefits.</discoveredLetterText>

		<description>While mechanical units are largely unconcerned by the passage of time and therefore unconcerned about the efficiency of its use, there are times when efficiency at a particular moment is critical. Consumable short-term stimulants could prove useful in these moments.</description>

        <description>With the acquisition of properly fabrication and a strong standardization scheme, advancements in the quality of mechanical parts is now within reach. These parts will function significantly better than factory standard equivalents while remaining within reasonable cost estimates.</description>

        <description>The framework of a mechanical unit is its most visible feature, as it quite literally holds the entire chassis together. Basic modifications could result in significant gains in a wide range of particular tasks - but does require committing to one particular modification at a time.</description>

		<description>While simple components and replacement parts can fix most physical damage to mechanical units, recovering the consciousness of a sapient mechanical entity is a more complicated process. Advanced tools and and intricate materials - with the technical knowhow to produce and incorporate - will be required to reactivate offline mechanical sapients.</description>

        <description>With standardized communication methods across hosts, it is theoretically possible to develop a framework for remotely controlling so-called surrogate bodies. Technical limitations prevent organic involvement in this service due to a lack of efficiency and universal organic applications, but this could prove revolutionary for mechanical units.</description>

        <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Surrogates</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>With network communication controls in place, core-less androids may now be turned into surrogates by installing a receiver core. Other pawns connected to the SkyMind network can activate surrogate controls to remotely pilot the body, sharing all skills (including learning) between the controller and surrogate. Controllers not contained within a SkyMind Core can only control so many surrogates before the stress of split attention begins to take a severe toll on learning and consciousness. Controllers are otherwise unaffected by this process.</discoveredLetterText>
